# memetic-algorithm-for-PCGMSTP
## PC-GMSTP
This code was written in the paper "An Adaptive Multi-Meme Memetic Algorithm for the prize-collecting generalized minimum spanning tree problem" by Chenwei Zhu and Yu Lin and Fuyuan Zheng and Juan Lin and Yiwen Zhong.

The basic framework of pc-gmstp is referred to the code of Carlos Contreras-Bolton and VÃ­ctor Parada. 

The instances are in the directory `instances`. The instances are in groups in the directory `in`. The results are in the direcotry `res`.

## AMMA for PC-GMSTP

To build the binary type:
```
make
```
To run the program:
```
./PCGMST
```

To modify the test pc-gmspt instances set and the relevant parameters of the algorithm, you can modify the various parameters in the main function of pcgmstp.cpp.
